# ðŸš‘ Ambulance Patient Prioritization using Gemini AI

This project is an **AI-powered emergency triage assistant** that takes **emergency call transcripts** (converted from speech-to-text) and automatically:

1. **Detects the most likely medical condition** of each patient.  
2. **Ranks patients by priority** (1 = most critical, 4 = least critical).  

It uses **Google Gemini API** for natural language understanding.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Accepts **realistic emergency call transcripts** (not just short symptom lists).  
- Detects likely **medical conditions** (e.g., cardiac arrest, asthma attack, fractures).  
- Outputs a **priority queue for ambulance dispatch**.  
- Lightweight â€” no local model downloads, only API calls.

## ðŸ–¼ Example Run

**Input (Call Transcripts):**

```text
"Patient A": "Hello, please send an ambulance quickly! My teacher just collapsed. 
He was clutching his chest, complaining of severe chest pain, and now heâ€™s unconscious. 
His blood pressure is very low.",

"Patient B": "Hi, I need help for my friend. He fell from his bike and broke his leg. 
Thereâ€™s a lot of pain but he is fully awake, talking, and his vitals seem okay.",

"Patient C": "Please hurry, my daughter is struggling to breathe. 
She has a history of asthma, she can barely talk right now and is gasping for air.",

"Patient D": "Yes, my neighbor cut himself while cooking. 
He has a few minor cuts on his arm, but heâ€™s fully conscious and the bleeding isnâ€™t serious."
```

**Output (Gemini AI):**

ðŸš‘ Patient Priority Ranking:
```text
Patient A â†’ Condition: Cardiac Arrest (Heart Attack) â†’ Priority 1  
Patient C â†’ Condition: Severe Asthma Attack â†’ Priority 2  
Patient B â†’ Condition: Leg Fracture â†’ Priority 3  
Patient D â†’ Condition: Minor Cuts â†’ Priority 4  
```
