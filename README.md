# ðŸš‘ Ambulance Patient Prioritization using Gemini AI

This project is an **AI-powered medical triage assistant** that takes **emergency call transcripts** (simulated or converted from speech-to-text) and automatically:

1. **Detects the most likely medical condition** of each patient.  
2. **Ranks patients by priority** (1 = most critical, 4 = least critical).  

It uses **Google Gemini API** for natural language understanding.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Converts **emergency call transcripts** into structured triage information.  
- Detects likely **medical conditions** (e.g., heart attack, asthma attack, fracture).  
- Outputs a **priority queue for ambulance dispatch**.  
- Simple to run â€” no local model downloads required.

## ðŸ–¼ Example Output

**Input (Call Transcripts):**
"Patient A": "Hello, please send an ambulance quickly! My teacher just collapsed. He was clutching his chest, complaining of severe chest pain, and now heâ€™s unconscious. His blood pressure is very low.",
"Patient B": "Hi, I need help for my friend. He fell from his bike and broke his leg. Thereâ€™s a lot of pain but he is fully awake, talking, and his vitals seem okay.", 
"Patient C": "Please hurry, my daughter is struggling to breathe. She has a history of asthma, she can barely talk right now and is gasping for air.", 
"Patient D": "Yes, my neighbor cut himself while cooking. He has a few minor cuts on his arm, but heâ€™s fully conscious and the bleeding isnâ€™t serious."

**Output (Gemini AI):**
ðŸš‘ Patient Priority Ranking:
Patient A â†’ Condition: Cardiac Arrest (Heart Attack) â†’ Priority 1
Patient C â†’ Condition: Severe Asthma Attack â†’ Priority 2
Patient B â†’ Condition: Leg Fracture â†’ Priority 3
Patient D â†’ Condition: Minor Cuts â†’ Priority 4
